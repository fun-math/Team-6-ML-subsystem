# Team-6-ML-subsystem

Disclaimer : The whole work is not yet complete so everything is organized in an ugly and not friendly manner. After the completion this page will look good (I hope so :P)

All images were generated by randomly taking screenshots of solidwork models.

This repo currently has the colab notebook of model1a which is a shapes classifier and model 1b which is a colour classifier. It also has some keras models with the naming convetion model<task>_<accuracy>.h5

Caution : Recently I changed the distribution between test and valid datasets so model1a_9891.h5 may give higher accuracy on the current validation dataset (former part of train set).

All the optimization task has been postponed till the completion of all tasks and a decent (>95% accuracy) for all tasks. So their is still some scope of increasing the accuracy.
